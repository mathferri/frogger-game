# Frogger Arcade Game

I made this game as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This is my first JavaScript app and I tried to respect good programming practices while also writing the least amount of code. Anyway I hope you have a fun couple of minutes playing this simple arcade game!

## Features

- Avatar selection: you can either be a boy or a girl – more genders to come (or not)!
- Time limit of 30 seconds
- Reaching the water gives you 100 points
- Getting hit by a bug loses you 500 points (life is unfair I know).

### Controls

Use the **arrow keys** to move your character.

## Installation

The game can be played online without installing anything here:
