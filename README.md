#Frogger Arcade Game

##Description

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This is my first JavaScript app and I've tried to respect good programming practices while writing the least amount of code possible to do what I want the game to do. Anyway I hope you have a couple of minutes of fun playing this simple Frogger game!

##How to play the game

The goal of the game is to make the highest score possible by reaching the water as many times as you can during the allotted 30 seconds.

Each time you reach the water your score increases by 100 points. But beware! To reach the water you have to cross a deadly motorway used by gigantic mutant bugs dotted with super-speed (some of them at least)! Every time you hit one of those bugs you lose 500 points.

Good luck!
