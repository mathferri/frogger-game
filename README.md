#Frogger Arcade Game

##Description

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This is my first JavaScript app and I tried to respect good programming practices while also writing the least amount of code. Anyway I hope you have a fun couple of minutes playing this Frogger game!

##How to play the game

At the beginning of the game, you can choose either one of two avatars: a girl or a boy. The goal of the game is to make the highest score possible by reaching the water as many times as you can during the allotted 30 seconds.

Each time you reach the water your score increases by 100 points. But beware! To reach the water you have to cross a deadly motorway used by gigantic mutant bugs dotted with super-speed (some of them at least)! Every time you hit one of those bugs you lose 500 points.
